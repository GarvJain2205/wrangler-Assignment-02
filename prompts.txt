🔧 Architecture & Setup
“Generate a high-level architecture for a web-based application that enables bidirectional data ingestion between ClickHouse and a flat file (CSV), including frontend, backend, and data processing layers.”

“Suggest the best tech stack for a full-stack app with backend in Go or Java and frontend in React for handling ClickHouse <-> Flat File ingestion.”

“Provide Docker setup instructions for a local ClickHouse instance with example datasets like uk_price_paid and ontime.”

📡 ClickHouse Integration
“Show me how to connect to ClickHouse using a JWT token for authentication in Go (or Python).”

“Write a function to fetch all table names from a ClickHouse database using the official ClickHouse Go client.”

“Give me code to run a SQL SELECT query in ClickHouse using JWT-based authentication.”

🗃️ Flat File Handling
“How to parse a CSV file in Go (or Java) and extract schema (column names, types) dynamically?”

“Show how to read a CSV file with user-defined delimiter and preview the first 100 rows.”

🔄 Data Ingestion Logic
“Write a Go function to ingest selected columns from a ClickHouse table into a CSV file using streaming or batching.”

“Write code to take a flat file (CSV) and ingest it into a new ClickHouse table, with schema inferred from CSV headers.”

“What is the best way to handle column data type mismatches between ClickHouse and a CSV file during ingestion?”

🖥️ Frontend & UI
“Create a React form for selecting a source (ClickHouse or Flat File), entering connection details, and listing tables or columns.”

“How to build a UI in React that displays table columns as checkboxes for selection?”

“Show an example React component to display a status area with states like Connecting, Ingesting, Completed, and Error.”

“Add a progress bar in React that updates based on ingestion progress (can be approximate).”

➕ Bonus / Advanced Features
“How to join multiple ClickHouse tables based on user input JOIN keys, and ingest the result into a flat file?”

“Write a JOIN query for ClickHouse that combines two tables based on user-defined keys.”

⚙️ Testing & Validation
“Give me a list of test cases for validating bidirectional ingestion between ClickHouse and flat files.”

“Create a Go test function that verifies the number of records transferred from ClickHouse to a CSV file.”
